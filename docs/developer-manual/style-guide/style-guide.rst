Style Guide
===========

|foxbms| has its own style guide, which is a set of conventions about how to
write code and documentation. We enforce a consistent style as it makes it
easier to understand the overall project. This project has general rules and
special rules for C/C++, Python, reStructuredText files and batch and shell
scripts.

The following sections describe the project's general and language specific
guidelines.
