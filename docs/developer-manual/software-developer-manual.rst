=========================

Depending on the application domain various functional safety standards exist.
A general norm that acts as a superset for domain-specific functional safety
standards is the IEC 61508-3 :cite:`IEC61508-3:2010`. Several breakdowns of
this norm are given in literature such as :cite:`Medoff2014`.

The software development manual is split into several documents:
