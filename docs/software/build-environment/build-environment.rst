Build Environment
=================

In order to have a consistent build environment on every developer machine,
|foxbms| provides predefined conda environments, that ships some tools that are
additionally needed to build |foxbms|.

A certain |foxbms| version requires certain software with in exact versions as
the project specifies them. By that, we are sure that every commit in the
repository can be built the same way on any machine that has all needed
dependencies.
