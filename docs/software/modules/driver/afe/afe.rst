.. _ANALOG_FRONT_END_API:

Analog Front-End API
====================

|foxbms| supports various AFE from different manufacturers as shown
in :ref:`SUPPORTED_ANALOG_FRONT_ENDS`.
This is achieved by drivers that implement the Analog Front-End API (AFE API).

This document describes how the AFE API works.

An example how to implement a new AFE API compatible driver is shown in
:ref:`HOW_TO_IMPLEMENT_AN_ANALOG_FRONT_END_DRIVER`.
