MAX1785x
========

..
    Comments:
    uphost and downhost are terms in Maxim driver to describe the communication path

.. spelling::
    uphost
    downhost

This module supports the `MAX17852` and `MAX17853` monitoring ICs by Maxim
Integrated.
Communication with these ICs is handled through a `MAX17841B` bridge IC.
The communication between bridge IC and monitoring IC is encoded
as Maxim Battery Management UART, which is a optimized, differential variant
of UART with a focus on robustness.

A typical setup consists of one master unit with one to two bridge ICs and
several monitoring ICs in a daisy-chain. The current implementation of the
driver supports communication through one bridge IC (the "uphost path"), but
the hardware supports a redundant approach by adding read only communication on
the "downhost path".

Driver structure
----------------

The driver is separated into three main modules with additional helper modules.
The three main modules are:

  * MAX17841B bridge IC driver in ``mxm_17841b.c``,
  * Battery Management UART protocol abstraction in
    ``max_battery_management.c`` and
  * MAX1785x device driver in ``mxm_1785x.c``.
