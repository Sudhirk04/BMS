   Naming conventions for battery system elements

- A **battery cell** or **cell** is the smallest unit in a battery system. It
  has one positive terminal and one negative terminal.
- Battery cells are usually connected in parallel to enhance the current
  capability of the system.
- **Battery cells** connected in parallel form a **(cell-)block**.
- **Cells** or **cell blocks** put in series form a **battery module**.
- **Several modules** connected in series form a **string**.
- **Several strings** connected in parallel form a **battery pack**.
- The highest unit is the **battery system**. It is formed by the conjunction
  of a **battery pack** and a **battery junction box (BJB)**. The BJB contains
  the elements used to control the current flow like power contactors and
  fuses.
