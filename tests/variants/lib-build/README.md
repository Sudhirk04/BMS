# Library Test Build

To run the library build test helper script ``lib-build.bat``, ``PowerShell``
and ``tar`` need to be available in PATH.
PowerShell should be available by default and ``tar`` is available e.g., in
*Git for Windows* at ``GIT_INSTALL_DIR/usr/bin``
(prepend to PATH if not available).
